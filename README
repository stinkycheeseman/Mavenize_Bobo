This project is solely for me to push my changes of bobo-browse to John Wang
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: I've changed the file structure and added a pom file to each sub-project in bobo-browse. 
Right now, everything that was in a different folder (ie bobo-browse, bobo-demo etc) each constitutes a different
project. I can probably change that if that's a problem.

TO TELL MAVEN USERS: The bobo jars will have to be manually added into people's personal repositories as they are
not in the maven repo online. Some projects depend on eachother (ie bobo-demo depends on bobo-gwt) so in order to get
them to compile on your machine, you need to build the gwt jar and add it to your repository manually. Obviously this
is not ideal and as this project matures we can add the jars into the big maven repo online.
