/**
 * Represents a request to search the {@link LocalService}.
 * A request to the {@link LocalService} must include at 
 * least one of a <code>point</code>, a parsed <code>address</code>, 
 * or an <code>addressStr</code>.  If multiple apear, the one that 
 * is used as the centroid of the local search is chosen in 
 * that preference order: point, address, then query.  If 
 * any is null, the latter is used instead.  Note that for a 
 * query, it is free-form, and the <code>LocalService</code>
 * must determine and automatically extract the address 
 * portions of the input query.
